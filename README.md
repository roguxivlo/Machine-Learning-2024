# Machine Learning, 2024

Machine Learning course in the Faculty of Mathematics, Informatics and Mechanics, University of Warsaw, summer semester of the academic year 2024/2025


# **Requirements for Passing the Lab Component**  


The lab component of the course is structured into two main parts:

- **Statistical Learning** *(7 classes)*  
- **Neural Networks** *(7 classes)*  

### 📚 **Homework Assignments**  
- Each student needs to **register their GitHub repository** for this course.
- After each class, students will receive a **homework assignment**.  
- Each assignment has a **two-week deadline**.  
  - For example, if the class is held on **March 1st**, the homework is due by **midnight on March 15th**.  
  - **Exceptions:** The deadlines for the **last two classes** will be set separately, depending on the semester schedule.
- Each assignment solution must be a **Colab notebook** placed in the student's **GitHub repository** for this course.
- Each assignment solution must begin with an **“Open in Colab”** badge so it can be launched directly from GitHub.
- In your repository’s **README** add a **link** to the notebook.

### 🧮 **Scoring System**  
- Each homework assignment will be graded on a scale of **0, 1, or 2 points**.  
- The maximum possible score for the lab section is **28 points**.

### ✅ **Passing Criteria**  
To pass the lab component of the course, students must meet the following **minimum requirements**:

1. **Earn at least 2 points** for **7 homework assignments** in total.  
2. **Complete at least 3 assignments** with 2 points in **each part** (*Statistical Learning* and *Neural Networks*).

❗ **Failure to meet these criteria will result in not passing the lab component of the course.**

### 💻 **Retake Policy**  
- A **computer-based exam** will be held during the **resit session** (pl. *sesja poprawkowa*) for students who did not meet the passing criteria or want to improve their grades.
